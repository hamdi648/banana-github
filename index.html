			<h1>Do YOU like Bananas?</h1>
			<p>A new Oxford study suggests that bananas have the highest concentration of yellow out of anything in exisitance. This means that the yellow from bananas are so pure that no other yellow can conpare! Banana yellow is quickly becoming the standard yellow used in industries around the world. However personally I dont find banana yellow very apPEALing!</p>
			<p>The study also suggests that science has proven that a banana is at least 25% better than an apple. This has lead to massive reports of an increase in the black market banana trade. Just last night 10 hooligans were arrested after being court selling illegal bananas. The chief of police said that they take this sort of crime very seriously and think they are on the trail to exposing the main black market banana suppliers within the UK.</p>
			<p>Do you drink banana smoothies? well according to banana right activists you should be put in prison! The regular consumption of bananas is a natural event and therefore does not impose on any banana rights however the blending of a banana into a smoothies is "gross and messy" according to one banana rights activist, "anyone consuming this product should lose their jobs and maybe serve jail time." Barry Gordon, a banana rights activist and author of the book "banana love", states that the way bananas are treated in modern society is "appalling"</p>
